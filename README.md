# Probability
Probability basics

Probability is the likelihood of an event occuring.
Probability is expressed numerically [numbers between 0-1].

Probability of 1: Absolute certernity of an event occuring.
Probability of 0: Absolute certernity of an event not occuring.

if A is the event, probability of A is denoted as P(A).

P(A) = preferred or favorable / all event or sample space

The idea with conditional probability is that we want to figure out the probability of something happening, given that we have some additional information that may influence the outcome.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)

A, B = events
P(A|B) = Probability of A given B is true
P(B|A) = Probability of B given A is true
P(A), P(B) = independent probability of A and B
